    Theranos
</h1>
  <p> <b>theranos</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"> (/ˈθɛrənoʊs/) </a> was an American privately held health technology corporation.
    <sup>[2]</sup> It was initially touted as a breakthrough technology company, with claims of having devised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test"> blood test</a>  that required 
    only very small amounts of blood and could be performed very rapidly using small automated devices 
    the company had developed. However, these claims were later proven to be false.<sup>[3][4][5]</sup> Founded in
     2003 by 19-year-old Elizabeth Holmes,<sup>[6]</sup> Theranos raised more than US$700 million from venture
      capitalists and private investors,<sup>[7] </sup>resulting in a $10 billion valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014

    In July 2016, Theranos received sanctions from the CMS, including the revocation of its CLIA 
    certificate and prohibition of Holmes and other company officials from owning or operating a 
    laboratory for two years.<sup>[13]</sup> Theranos announced it would close its laboratory operations and
     wellness centers to work on miniature medical testing machines.<sup>[14]</sup> In April 2017, Theranos
      said it had reached a settlement agreement with CMS.<sup>[15]</sup> Following the CMS sanctions, the Walgreens
       pharmacy chain terminated its contract with Theranos and filed a lawsuit claiming continuous breaches
        of contract. The suit was settled out of court, with Theranos compensating Walgreens for a much
         smaller amount than the claimed $140 million, reported at about $30 million. After efforts to
          find a buyer went nowhere, what remained of the company dissolved on September 4, 2018.<sup>[16]</sup>

    On March 14, 2018, Theranos, Holmes, and former company president Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani were charged
     with "massive fraud" by the SEC.[17] One section of the complaint says Holmes falsely claimed in 2014
      that the company had annual revenues of $100 million, a thousand times more than the actual figure
       of $100,000.[18] Theranos and Holmes agreed to resolve the charges against them, with Holmes paying
        a fine of $500,000, returning the remaining 18.9 million shares that she held, relinquishing her
         control of the company, and being barred from being an officer or director of any public company
          for ten years.[19] According to the agreement, if Theranos were acquired or otherwise liquidated,
           Holmes would not profit from her ownership until more than $750 million was returned to investors
            and other preferred shareholders. Theranos and Holmes neither admitted nor denied the allegations
             in the SEC's complaint.[7] Balwani did not settle.[20] On June 15, 2018, the U.S. Attorney for 
             the Northern District of California announced the indictment of Holmes on wire fraud and
              conspiracy charges. Balwani was also indicted on the same charges.[21] The trial was scheduled 
              to commence in August 2020,[22] but it has been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Holmes'
               pregnancy. Holmes' trial is currently scheduled to begin on August 31, 2021[23], while
                Balwani's trial has been postponed until January 11, 2022.[24]
